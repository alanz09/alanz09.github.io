	</div>


			<p>How has the global landscape shaped these numbers over time?</p>
		<p>And is there a basis for Trump's focus on Syrian refugees?</p>

<!-- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/donald-trump-administration.html - looking into UN reaction and how it is unconstitutional 

I want to know the percentage of refugees admitted to the US from each country over the years so I can show and make sense of trends over time. What are the differences between types of refugees seeking asylum in the US (affirmative vs. defensive)? How have current events and presidential mandates shaped the number of refugees coming to the US over time?

		Syrian refugees are suspended indefinitely.</p>
